## Note that the way physics states relate to action states, is different than you may expect.
## Don't think of it as, say, "You can only be in the Jump action while using Ground physics"
## It's more like, "The Jump action can only start itself while using Ground physics"
## Any action can be paired with any physics. It's better for flexibility, that way.
